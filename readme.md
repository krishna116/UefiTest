## My personal test tools used under UEFI Shell.
How to build it.  
1,Download https://github.com/tianocore/edk2 and get ready for UEFI development.  
2,Copy KrishnaTestPkg to your workspace(usually it is edk2-root-dir).  
3,Run "edksetup.bat" to construct build environment.  
4,Run "build -p KrishnaTestPkg\KrishnaTestPkg.dsc -a X64" to build it.

How to using it.  
Please refer user-guides under document dir.  

Note  
This tool(ReadHistory.efi) has got some idea from Z.t(http://www.lab-z.com/), thank you very much.
